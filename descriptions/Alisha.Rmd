### Description

Hello! Iâ€™m a 2nd year Masters student at the Rollins School of Public Health studying to obtain a Masters of Public Health in Epidemiology. Previously, at the University of Texas at Austin, I obtained a Bachelors of Science in Biology with a concentration in Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and a certificate in Scientific Computation. While I have previous experience in genomic engineering, neuroimmunology, and statistical genetics research, I am currently looking to delve into public health practice.

In general, I enjoy analyzing and presenting data so that it can be used to make meaningful decisions. I like working on problems that require a multidisciplinary approach, and draw from my variegated skillset. Lastly, I readily welcome opportunities to learn new skills and new subject matter.
